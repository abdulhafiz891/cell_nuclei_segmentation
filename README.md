# Science_Bowl_2018
Data Science Bowl 2018 competition hosted on Kaggle, which aimed to create an algorithm to enhance lung cancer detection using computed tomography (CT) scans. The competition provided a dataset of more than 1,000 CT scans, each annotated with information about the presence of lung tumors. The challenge was to build an algorithm that could accurately detect lung tumors in the CT scans, while minimizing the number of false positive detections.

The data provided on the competition website includes:

Training data: a set of CT scans with annotations indicating the presence of lung tumors
Testing data: a set of CT scans without annotations (to be used for making predictions)
A sample submission file to show the format of the final predictions.
The competition used the CODEX metric to evaluate the performance of the submitted models, which was based on the balance between the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm, as well as the number of false positives per scan.

Participants were encouraged to use any machine learning and image processing techniques they deemed necessary, but were also provided with some starter code as a guide.

Additionally, the competition organizers also provided a detailed data description and a guide to the data format to help participants understand the data better.
